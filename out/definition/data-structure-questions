Please answer the below Data Structure Questions:

why do we need data structure?
A. For software programming, efficient algorithm, management of huge databases.

What are the various operations that can be performed on different Data Structures?
A. Traversing, searching, inserting, deleting, sorting and merging.

List out the areas in which data structures are applied extensively?
A. Database mangement system, operating system, compiler design, numerical analysis, statistical analysis package, graphics,
    artificial intelligence, and simulation.

what is an Array?
A. An array is dynamically created objects that serves as a container to hold constant numbers of values of the same type.
    Memory space is allocated by declaring an array.

what is the difference between the Array and ArrayList?
A. Array has fixed length data structure, that is ststic in size. ArrayList has instance variables capacity which indicates
the size of the arralist, that is dynamic in size. ArraList cannot contain primitive datatype, it can only contain object.
 Array can contain both primitive datatypes as well as objects.

what is LinkedList?
A. LinkedList class uses doubly linked list to store the elements which provides linked list data structure. Java LinkedList class
    can contain duplicate elements, maintains insertion order, can be used as list, stack or queue.

How is an Array different from Linked List?
A. Array is a collection of elements having same data type with common name, Linked list is an ordered collection of
    elements which are connected by links. array provides fast and random access, in linked list elements can not be accessed randomly.
    Elements are stored in consecutive manner in memory in array, elements can be stored at any available place in Linked List.

what is queue?
A. Queue is a data structure that holds elements prior to processing, the processing is called First In First Out (FIFO).

what is stack?
A. Stack is data structure based upon the principle of last-in-first-out.

what is FIFO and LIFO?
A. FIFO- First In First Out, LIFO- Last-In-First-Out.

what is the order of complexity?
A.
what is the best case to search an element from an array?
A. Best case for a simple linear search on a list occurs when the desired element is the first element of the list.

what is the worst case to search an element from an array?
A. The worst case scenario for a algorithm is not finding a matching record. In this case it is necessary to step through the entire array and match against every single item.
    If we have 1024 items in the array, then we have to test all 1024 items to confirm that a match cannot be found.

what is tree in data structure?
A. A tree is a collection of nodes connected by directed (or undirected) edges, tree is a nonlinear data structure, compared to arrays,
    linked lists, stacks and queues which are linear data structures. A tree can be empty with no nodes or a tree is a
    structure consisting of one node called the root and zero or one or more subtrees.

what is graph in data structure?
A.A Graph is a non-linear data structure consisting of nodes and edges.
    The nodes are sometimes also referred to as vertices and the edges are lines or arcs that connect any two nodes in the graph.

what is the difference between the HashTable and HashMap?
A. HashTable and HashMap are data structures for web-based and other applications. HasMap allows null values, HashTable do not allow null values
    in data structuring. HashMap contains iterator, HashTable contains enumerator. Access to HasTable is synchronized on the table, access to
    HashMap is not synchronized.

What are the major data structures used in the following areas : RDBMS, Network data model and Hierarchical data model.
A. RDBMS Array, Network data model graph and Hierarchical data model Trees.

How HashMap works in java?
A. HashMap works based on hashing principles and internally uses hashcode as a base.

What is ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException in java? When it occurs?
A. The program is trying to access an element at an index that is outside the out of array bounds.

What are the different ways of copying an array into another array?
A. Manually, Arrays.CopyOf(), System.arraycopy() and Object.clone(0).

What is difference between an array and a linked list?
A. Arrays are data structure to store collection of elements. Linked list is also data structure that can be used to store collection of elements.
   Array is allocated as a single block of memory and each element gets its own space in the array, its size is fixed.
   A linked list allocates memory to its elements separately in its own block of memory and the overall structure is obtained by linking these elements as links in a chain.

What is DFS and BFS?
A. DFS is Depth First Search, BFS is Breadth First Search.

What is Recursion?
A. Recursion is a basic programming technique, a method calls itself to solve problem.

What are linear and non linear data Structures?
A. Linear data structure is a structure that organizes its data elements one after the other.  Construction of Nonlinear data structures occurs by attaching a data element to
    several other data elements in such a way that it reflects a specific relationship among them.
    In linear data structures, the organization of data elements are sequential while in nonlinear data structures, the organization of data elements is not sequential.

What is Big-(O)-notation?
A. Big-(O)-notation is used to describe the asymptotic upper bound of performance or complexity for a given function.

Outlined different kind of sorting algorithm with time complexity?
A. Selection sort
Bubble sort
Insertion sort
Heap sort
Quick sort
Merge sort
Bucket sort
Redix sort

Draw a table with time complexity in which it will summarize all the data structure feature's advantages and disadvantages.
  a)In terms of Accessing element.
  b)In terms of Inserting element.
  c)In terms of Searching element.
  d)In terms of Removing element.
